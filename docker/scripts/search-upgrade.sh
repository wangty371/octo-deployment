# Hot-upgrade an already-running OCTO stack from "search off" to "search on"
# WITHOUT downtime for the core IM service. Idempotent and re-entrant: every
# step is safe to re-run, and each ends with an exit-code gate (G1..G5) so the
# whole flow is mechanically verifiable in CI or by an operator.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# State machine (producer-first + high-watermark cursor-seed ordering):
#
#   no search
#     -> (1) docker compose --profile search up -d   (Kafka + OpenSearch + indexer)
#     -> (2) seed searchetl cursor to each shard's MAX(id)        [G1]
#     -> (3) turn the real-time producer on (octo-server restart) [G2]
#     -> (4) one-shot backfill of history + inline reconcile gate [G3]
#     -> (5) bind read alias -> physical octo-message index       [G4]
#     -> (6) switch octo-server reader to es + restart            [G5]
#   search live
#
# Why this order: the producer is turned on (step 3) BEFORE backfill (step 4)
# so no live message written during the historical load is missed — the cursor
# was seeded to the high-watermark first (step 2) so the producer only streams
# messages newer than the cut-over, never the full history. Backfill and the
# live stream overlap safely because the ES doc _id = message_id makes every
# write an idempotent upsert.
#
# Usage:
#   docker/scripts/search-upgrade.sh            # run all steps from the start
#   docker/scripts/search-upgrade.sh --from 3   # resume at step N (1..6)
#   docker/scripts/search-upgrade.sh --check     # run only the verification
#                                                # gates against current state
#
# All `docker compose` calls run from docker/ with the repo's compose file.
# Override OCTO_SEARCH_* in docker/.env exactly as the compose file documents.
